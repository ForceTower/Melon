/**
 * Exactly the same as SpannableStringBuilder, but it returns its spans in reverse.
 * <p/>
 * What effect does this have? Well, if you're building up a Spannable recursively (as we
 * are doing in Bypass) then returning the spans in reverse order has the correct effect
 * in some corner cases regarding leading spans.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * Suppose we have a BLOCK_QUOTE with a LIST inside of it. Both of them have leading spans, but the LIST
 * span is set first. As a result, the QuoteSpan for the BLOCK_QUOTE is actually indented by the LIST's span!
 * If the order is reversed, then the LIST's margin span is properly indented (and the BlockQuote remains on
 * the side).
