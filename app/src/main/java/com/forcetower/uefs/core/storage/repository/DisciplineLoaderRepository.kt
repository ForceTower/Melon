     * This is a funny function
     * It will load the details of any discipline that matches the requirements, if all the parameters
     * are null, it will load the details of every single discipline.
     *
     * This function may take several minutes to complete, it's better to be called within a service
     * or something that shows to the user that this long operation is running.
     *
     * Funny fact: It only saves the data once it has completed downloading everything, a network
     * connection fail during the process will generate a catastrophic fail.
     *
     * Note to myself: save the data when it is ready, don't wait until everything completes
     *
     * Second note: add a "don't load this discipline", kind of a blacklist so the process can load
     * it faster
     *
     * Third note: add a "simple load" and a "complex load". Simple load will only fetch the teacher
     * name, which is the common use for this function.
